Unfixed Glitches:
2. Platforms are disregarded after certain velocities

Possible Solutions:
2. Make platform bottoms thicker, make platforms velocity resistant (however one goes about doing that)

Fixed Glitches:
1. Slamming into the side of stage at certain velocity will force a ledge snap,
    no matter your height (Fixed in 1.0.2)
3. Animation frames are frozen when sliding off a platform mid-animation (Fixed in 1.0.2)
4. After falling through a platform, get transported to ledge (Fixed in 1.0.2)
5. If holding down, animations don't return to idle (Fixed in 1.0.3)
6. If you fast-fall above the wall, you will collide with it (at certain velocities, same as 2.) (Fixed in 1.0.2)
7. If connects with blastzone while dashing, respawn position changes (in terms of x) (Fixed in 1.0.2)
8. Attacking while they are in knockback will change their momentum, even if it doesn't connect (Fixed in 1.0.3)
9. Landing and changing direction with FAIR changes attack direction (Fixed in 1.0.3)
10. Landing with FAIR on a certain frames and holding attack launches a sliding f-tilt (Fixed in 1.0.3)
11. F-tilt hitbox appears before F-tilt animation if performed after landing aerial,
    then appears again at correct time (Fixed in 1.0.3)
12. Crouch Boosting. By inputting Crouch, Jump and forward/ backwards within 7 frames of each other,
does Jump + Dash (Fixed in 1.0.3)
