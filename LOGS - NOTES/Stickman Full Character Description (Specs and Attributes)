Stickman is currently an unnamed introductory character, not for the player, but rather for the
development team. Stickman is likely not going to be included in the final project, but will be
used for gaining experience in animation and programming, for playable demos and for character
templates.

Balance in attacks and attributes is not highly considered, but considered nonetheless. Mechanics such as
dashing and shielding will be thoroughly balanced. Universal Mechanics will be given to the Stickman first
and then other characters, even if they have been added when other characters exist. For all intents and
purposes, this is absolutely a test character.
