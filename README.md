# Platform-Fighter
An Unnamed Platform Fighter brought to you by Me!

Hello All! This is an unnamed project (for now) about building a unique and interesting Platform Fighter! One for all to enjoy! 

This was inspired during my own development of a Rivals of Aether workshop character, and I got to thinking about the genre of all whole. This is a genre I and many others are passionate about, yet so few games actually exist. 

With my 1000+ hours of Smash experience, a limited knowledge of programming, a group of friends to help me and, most importantly, a passion for the game I wish to share. 

This is the birth of a new game with the fans of the genre in mind. The goal is to reinforce why are you playing a platform fighter in the first place, while keeping it fun and creative. There is obviously heavy inspiration from other games in this genre, like Smash and Rivals of Aether. I want this game to have something for everyone.

Currently, this is a criminally underpowered project (as the art section can attest to), so any form of help is appreciated. When I say this should be a game for everyone, I mean everyone. Every piece of advice and criticism is appreciated, since you are probably not the only person who feels or will feel that way.

For the Programmers, this is being built using Pygame. Not the most optimal language, but I'm most comfortable with it, so I'll be using it.

As of now, there is no intention to monetize this project. It is simply being done as a fun game for people to enjoy. Not for profit. This may change in the future, but for now, this stands.

After a lot of time and consideration, the games core values have finally been decided on and set in motion. 

Super Smash Bros, in my eyes at least, has always been about celebrating the long history of video games by assembling it's most famous icons to fight one big game. This is one way doing it, but there are others as well. 

Smash has always had one limiting factor though, conventional character design. Smash characters have limits to how much they can truly represent any given game, despite the DLC characters getting progressively crazier. If you took the survey, you might know where I'm going with this.

I propose that video game history can be demonstrated in another way, directly through the mechanics of that genres throughout the past 40+ years that video games have been around. 

While less familiar to the general population, game mechanics in any genre are a large reason to enjoy that particular genre. What if mixing those game mechanics into one big fighting game is the way to make a game that everyone can enjoy?

The new goal of this game is to become a single game that can unite all games through the best method possible, the elegant art of stabbing the crap out of each other. The goal is to create a fighting game where, no matter what your gaming background is, there will be a character for you.

For example: 
A platfomer based character will have extra movement systems. Unique ways to move around the stage, which other characters might not have access to.

An RPG based character might carry a level up system, just like in RPGs.

Strategy characters might contain some sort of resource gimmick, or may require more in-depth decision making, in line with a strategy game.

And more...

This is all still currently in early Alpha, and this document (along with others) will be updated as the project comes along.
